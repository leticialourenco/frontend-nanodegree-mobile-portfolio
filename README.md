## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.

### General changes

* Compressed the images profilepic.jpg and pizzeria.jpg
* Embedded above-the-fold CSS to eliminate render-blocking
* Minified the CSS
* Added media="print" for print.css to eliminate render-blocking
* Added async attribute to javascript files
* Added .htaccess file to leverage browser caching

### Cam's Pizzeria changes

* Embedded CSS files
* Minified CSS files
* Compressed the images pizzeria.jpg and pizza.png
* Added the property ```backfact-visibility:hidden``` to ```.mover``` to reduce repainting time - so it repaints only the moving pixels
* Toke out of the loop the calculation and declaration of constants so they won't do unnecessary re-calculations on each loop iteration 
* Toke calculation of ```phase``` out of the main loop - so they don't need to calculate over every single iteration (only the useful 5 times)
* Exchange all uses of the ```querySelectorAll``` to ```getElementsByClassName``` - since the second is faster
* Made changes to the function ```changePizzaSizes(size)``` so the DOM is accessed only once per loop iteration (by creating a var wrapping the access and using its value)
* Removed unnecessary pizzas from ```addEventListener``` (200 pizzas were unreasonable since most of them weren't visible)
* Adapted the function ```logAverageFrame``` to measure the last 60 frames instead of the last 10
